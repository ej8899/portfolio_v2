      Software developers cannot freely use the term "software engineer" in Canada as the title of
      "engineer" is protected by law and can only be used by individuals who are licensed by one of
      the provincial or territorial engineering regulators. These regulators are responsible for
      ensuring that engineers meet high standards of education, experience, ethics, and
      professionalism, and that they protect the public interest and safety in their work. By using
      the title of "engineer", software developers may imply that they have the same qualifications
      and obligations as licensed engineers, which may not be the case.

      This could allegedly mislead the public and create confusion about the scope and quality of
      the services provided by software developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      That all being said, there are regular cases being brought forward to allow the use of
      "software engineer" without the requirement for official provincial licensing. At the time of
      this writing however, developers in Canada are not to use the term "software engineer" and
      could be subject to fines if used without being licensed.
