    <p>
      Software developers cannot freely use the term "software engineer" in Canada as the title of
      "engineer" is protected by law and can only be used by individuals who are licensed by one of
      the provincial or territorial engineering regulators. These regulators are responsible for
      ensuring that engineers meet high standards of education, experience, ethics, and
      professionalism, and that they protect the public interest and safety in their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using the title of "engineer", software developers may imply that they have the same
      qualifications and obligations as licensed engineers, which may not be the case. This could
      allegedly mislead the public and create confusion about the scope and quality of the services
      provided by software developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      That all being said, there are cases being brought forward to allow the use of "software
      engineer" without the requirement for official provincial licensing. At the time of this
      writing however, developers in Canada are not to use the term "software engineer" and could be
      subject to fines if used without being licensed.

      <br />
      For these major projects (ranging from $300 million to $4.7 billion), my role progressed from
      Utilities Coordinator to Utilities Superintendent and ultimately Utilities Manager.
      <br />
      <br />
      Duties included managing the safe construction of bridges, roads and buildings in and around
      existing buried and overhead facilities including major gas and oil pipelines and power
      systems. This safe work methodology required the use of my tech skills to develop training
      programs, interactive 'paperwork', sharing of utility information and shared mapping of
      utility hazards, approval documents and more.
      <br />
      <br />
      The mapping systems I would implement would include Google Maps systems that allowed custom
      markers and linking back into secure Sharepoint data systems.
      <br />

      ></img>
      <br />
      <br />
      Additional duties included the management and training of field level workers in safe utility
      excavation techniques, developing safe execavation training programs (live and via regular
      'tool box talk' documentation as well as video/Powerpoint presentations).

      <br />
      Although largely considering myself a self-taught programmer and web developer, I did attend a
      coding bootcamp program at LighthouseLabs.ca in 2022.
      <br />
      <br />
      This program largely concentrated on Javascript programming along with HTML and CSS, but
      touched on SQL, Ruby, Ruby on Rails as well (the latter being more of a way to get people
      exposed to different languages that we could experience during future endeavours).
      <br />
      <br />
      Overall, I found the program to be excellent and would highly recommend it to others.
      <br />
      Live instructor led seminars and the availability of "on-demand" mentors was a great way for
      me to see what was new in the web application development world and renew my interest in
      developing my skills into a new career path!

      <br />
      My first exposure to computers and programming takes me way back to when Commodore first
      released the VIC-20. I was eager to pickup the latest Compute! magazine and frantically type
      out code to play the latest games. Only to more often than not be greeted with the famous
      "syntax error". Hey, it was frustrating, but great for growing my debugging skills!

        alt='old BASIC code from compute! magazine'
      ></img>
      <br />
      <br />
      Eventually, I upgraded to the Tandy CoCo2 and started building my own simple dungeon crawler
      first person games using its 'enhanced' graphics systems and the Basic language!
      <br />
      <br />
      Getting back into coding now, I quite regret not having any of these old relics still to setup
      an antique 'home lab'!

      <br />
      Yes, I'm a bit of a hardware 'collector' and do thoroughly enjoy building systems including
      servers, desktops and various other homelab equipment complete with automation systems.
      <br />
      <br />
      As a part of what I already do is operate a cluster of server systems totalling well over
      300Tb of storage. Some of this space is rented to clients across Canada for data backup as
      well as remote data access for a civil engineering team with offices in Calgary, Regina and
      Toronto. Their data must remain accessible across the globe.
      <br />
      <br />
      In addition to this 'large-ish' storage server system, I also operate a shared hosting service
      for a handful of select clients (largely running Wordpress sites). Although the server
      maintenance I'm required to do is quite minimal, I am required to review server logs to ensure
      everyone is in compliance with TOS for system usage and troubleshoot any failed Wordpress
      installs and updates.
